        </section>

        <section style="color:#0d3a83; ">
            <p>SEPCA is acronym for Security, Psychology, Criminology and Academics, which are the core fields of our interest and occupation.  
                <br>During the last 15 years of theoretical and practical work in these areas, we have recognized that dealing with them without 
                multidisciplinary approach and active work with individuals, companies and communities will not lead to the expected changes. 
                <br>Precisely in order to bring about the desired changes, we founded SEPCA!</p>
